## Description
To save your spaceship, you need to troubleshoot your communication technology in order to send a message to approaching aliens. Things keep going wrong, and you need to use some troubleshooting tips and tricks to solve the problems!

The player's in-game goal is to successfully communicate with the aliens, and the real-world goal is for them to practice troubleshooting techniques without focusing too much on the technology itself.
